  abstract  = {ABSTRACT Due to practical limitations, geophysical acquisitions for natural resource exploration are always performed at scattered points in space. To derive more rational and accurate interpretations about physical properties of earth forming materials, it is necessary to interpolate geophysical data in a dense and regular grid as a preliminary step. This article introduces a method for interpolation of scattered data using multilevel B‐splines to estimate field values on a dense and regular grid based on original sparse and irregular data. The algorithm applies an effective B‐splines approximation technique to a hierarchy of control lattices to generate a sequence of functions whose sum approaches the desired interpolation function. This method is implemented successfully in interpolation on both synthetic and real magnetic anomaly data sets. In comparison, it achieves better results than inverse distance weighing, kriging and minimum curvature methods.}

  abstract     = {Cardiac motion analysis can play an important role in cardiac disease diagnosis. Tagged magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the ability to directly and non-invasively alter tissue magnetization and produce tags on the deforming tissue. This paper proposes an approach to analysis of tagged MR images using a multilevel B-splines fitting model incorporating phase information. The novelty of the proposed technique is that phase information is extracted from SinMod.<sup>1</sup> By using real tag intersections extracted directly from tagged MR image data and virtual tag intersections extracted from phase information, both considered to be scattered data, multilevel B-spline fitting can result in accurate displacement motion fields. The B-spline approximation which also serves to remove noise in the displacement measurements is performed without specifying control point locations explicitly and is very fast. Dense virtual tag intersections based on SinMod were created and incorporated into the multilevel B-spline fitting process. Experimental results on simulated data from the 13-parameter kinematic model of Arts et al.<sup>2</sup> and in vivo canine data demonstrate further improvement in accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method.},
